methods: Adaptive ensemble combining exponential growth detection with gradient boosting
methods_long: This model employs an adaptive ensemble strategy that dynamically adjusts
  model weights based on detected growth regimes. For explosive growth patterns, it
  emphasizes exponential curve fitting with proper uncertainty quantification. For
  stable patterns, it relies more on gradient boosting machines with lag features
  and rolling statistics. The ensemble automatically adapts to changing epidemic dynamics.
