methods_long: "A sliding window is used to construct a temporally local approximation of the Koopman operator. Time-delays and radial basis functions are used for the lifting to function space. All Ontario regions are used to construct the approximation of the Koopman operator to estimate couplings/correlations. Spectral information of the local approximation of the Koopman operator is compared to spectral information from previous sliding windows. If there is a match, the past information is used to inform the prediction.
